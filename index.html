      <p>
        We build easy-to-use tools for engineers, enabling you to work more
        efficiently. As engineering projects grow increasingly complex, the
        existing software stack falls short in adapting to a rapidly changing
        landscape with numerous diverse domains. Most engineering software is
        overly specialized and complicated, making it difficult for non-experts
        to use effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide software tools that facilitate teamwork and collaboration
        across various domains and departments. Our tools enable you to
        integrate engineering knowledge directly into the product, creating an
        engineering system linked to all relevant data points. This single
        source of truth forms the foundation of an effective engineering system,
        allowing seamless collaboration with others. Given the sensitivity of
        engineering data and intellectual property, our tools are designed with
        robust data security and safety measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        We view the engineering process as an exciting and dynamic journey, free
        from tedious and repetitive tasks. Consider the sketch below, which
        illustrates this process as a series of cycles where each iteration
        brings new insights and data. These new insights and data are then used
        to optimize and tweak the model, facilitating further iterations and
        ultimately leading to the most fitting solution.

        To achieve this ambitious goal, we have decided to
        <a href="#open-source">open-source</a> most of our software. By doing
        so, we aim to build trust within our community. However, to provide the
        most value, some parts will remain
        <a href="#closed-source">closed-source</a> to allow for custom and
        privacy-critical solutions for end-users and other companies. If you
        want to see what the future holds for powell-donovan, take a look at our

        We believe in the value that open-source software brings to all users.
        Our core modules are open-sourced and hosted on
        <a href="https://github.com/powell-donovan">GitHub</a>. Powell-Donovan
        is structured as an open-source development environment (<a
          href="https://github.com/powell-donovan/dev-environment"
          >dev-environment</a
        >) that hosts all the core modules in a single workspace. If you want to
        contribute to the capabilities of Powell-Donovan, this is the best way
        to get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dev-environment is structured into individual modules, each
        representing a different capability. These modules can be compiled into
        standalone, hostable solutions. Anyone can build these solutions, which
        can either be locally hosted and accessed via the powell-donovan
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: gray"
          >web-interface (coming soon)</span
        >
        or accessed directly from our provided servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to host a solution, the best way to get started is by
        following our guide on
        <a href="https://github.com/powell-donovan/dev-environment"
          >How to host a solution</a

      <p>
        In addition to our public open-source solutions, we offer private
        solutions that are custom-built for end-users or other companies. These
        private solutions are not open-source, as they contain customer data and
        intellectual property, which is not available to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for being closed-source, these private solutions use the same
        functionality provided by the core modules. Private solutions can also
        be self-hosted or hosted on our servers, depending on where the compute
        happens and where the data is stored. Access to any solution is the
        same, using our
        <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: gray"
          >web-interface (coming soon)</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building private solutions also serves as a means to generate sufficient
        revenue to sustain the continued development of powell-donovan.
